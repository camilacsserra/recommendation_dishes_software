# recommendation_dishes_software
*This is a portfolio project for the "Computer Science" Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).*

Recommendation_Dishes_Software is a Python terminal program designed to help users explore traditional dishes from various countries. It provides information about ingredients, preparation time, and common allergens associated with each dish. By selecting a country, users can access a list of its traditional dishes.

The next phase of development for this project involves expanding the functionality of the Menu_Tool class. The aim is to incorporate modules that can automatically generate a weekly menu and a corresponding shopping list based on user input. This enhancement will provide users with a convenient way to plan their meals and organize their grocery shopping.
 

## Installation
*To run the program you should have Python installed.*

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Recommendation_Software.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd recommendation_dishes_software
   ```



## Usage

1. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python3 recommendation_software.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program.

   - Upon launching the program, you will be greeted with a welcome message and an introduction to the functionality.
   - You can enter the first letter of a country's name to view available options starting with that letter.
   - Once you select a country by entering its corresponding number, the program will display a list of traditional dishes from that country.
   - For each dish, you can view information such as the ingredients, preparation time, and common allergens.
   - You can choose to see more dishes or exit the program.
   - In the program, the Menu_Tool class is instantiated and the following code is executed:

   ```bash
   option_1.dishes_available_by_country()
   ```

   - By editing the code script, you have the ability to perform some operations. You can add new dishes to the existing dictionary, remove dishes, and print all the available dishes for each country.
